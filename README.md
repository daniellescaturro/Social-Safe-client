# Social Safe App
In preparation for this capstone project, I talked with a number of friends about what kind of app would be useful to them. Given the time in which we live, with the COVID pandemic, they all reported a sense of unease about going out to their favorite restaurants and other venues. As a result, they are spending more time isolated than usual. We all need to socialize and spend time with our friends and family, but we need to ensure that we’re being safe and smart about it. My friends wanted an app where they could learn about the outdoor spaces and social distancing practices of various eateries and gathering places. In addition, since we are in a temperate climate and it was fall, now turned to winter, they wanted to know which businesses had heat lamps. This all led to the design of the Social Safe app. Social Safe enables users to view its database which contains information about social distance ratings and presence of head lamps as well as the Yelp rating as reference. It also provide favorites and review functionality, where users can provide general and social distancing ratings and leave descriptive comments. Social Safe also can search the Yelp API by location. Search results are presented in the Social Safe format and can be added to the database with full functionality available. Users have the ability to add new entries and edit and delete records they’ve added.
